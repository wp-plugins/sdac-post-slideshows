Highly customizable slideshows for your posts and pages using jQuery Cycle.

== Description ==
The SDAC Post Slideshows plugin allows you to easily add customizable slideshows into your posts using jQuery Cycle.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. If you're uploading it make sure to upload
the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a new post or page, fill in the "Post Slideshow" fields, and add the slideshow to your content using the [post-slideshow] shortcode.

Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I do not see the button to add this into the content. Where is it?
Click on the HTML tab in the editor and you will see it.

= Where can I get support for this plugin?
You can submit any issues/feedback: http://sandboxdev.com/forums/forum/sdac-post-slideshows

= Do all slideshows have the same width/height?
No. You can easily change the size of your slideshow for each post by adjusting the general settings within the post.

= How many slides can we have?
As many as you want - just add more as needed.

= Can I use just images in the slideshow or just text?
Yes - just fill in the information you need when creating a slide and set the appropriate widths in the general settings.

= How can I use this within my WordPress template?
You can use the WordPress function do_shortcode([post_slideshow post_id="1"]) (Post ID is the ID of the post you want to use)
